  abstract = {The Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) has seen significant growth in recent years. With the deployment of 5G, it has become essential to reduce the power consumption of these devices for long-term sustainability. The upcoming 6G cellular network introduces the concept of zero-energy CIoT devices, which do not require batteries or manual charging. This paper focuses on these devices, providing insight into their feasibility and practical implementation. The paper examines how CIoT devices use simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, beamforming, and backscatter communication techniques. It also analyzes the potential use of energy harvesting and power management in zero-energy CIoT devices. Furthermore, the paper explores how low-power transceivers can lower energy usage while maintaining dependable communication functions.}
