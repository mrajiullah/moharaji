  abstract = {The deployment of 5G networks, including 5G Non-Public Networks (5G-NPNs) for private use in several verticals, is rapidly taking place worldwide. However, deploying these networks in under-served areas, where there may be limited Internet access or wired backhauling capabilities, presents challenges. To address these challenges, there is a growing interest in using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, such as SpaceX's Starlink, which can provide high-throughput and low-latency Internet access via dense satellite constellations.In this paper, we present CARL-W, the Wireless module of the Communications Advanced Research Laboratory (CARL) at Karlstad University, which combines a 5G-NPN and a Starlink deployment. CARL-W serves as a platform for empirical analyses on both systems, thus contributing to the study of their possible integration. In particular, we outline the CARL-W experimentation framework and provide access to the CARL-W visualization and data exporting platform. We also open-source a 1-month Starlink dataset, facilitating further analyses of this relatively new technology.},
