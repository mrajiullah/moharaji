  abstract = {The present Internet limits the performance of applications that need real-time interaction. This is in part because the design of the network has been optimised to boost throughput, maximising efficiency for bulk applications. However, changes in use have resulted in that an increasing number of applications now depend on timely delivery. One of the targets of the RITE project is to reduce internet transport latency in support of such applications. Initial results from the project on how end nodes can be optimized for more timely error recovery are presented in this poster.},
