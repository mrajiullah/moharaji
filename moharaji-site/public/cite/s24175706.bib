  ABSTRACT = {Deploying Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) devices in urban and remote areas faces significant energy efficiency challenges. This is especially true for Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) devices, which are expected to function on a single charge for up to 10 years while transmitting small amounts of data daily. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced energy-saving mechanisms in Releases 13 to 16, including Early Data Transmission (EDT) and Preconfigured Uplink Resources (PURs). These mechanisms extend battery life and reduce latency by enabling data transmission without an active Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection or Random Access Procedure (RAP). This paper examines these mechanisms using the LENA-NB simulator in the ns-3 environment, which is a comprehensive framework for studying various aspects of NB-IoT. The LENA-NB has been extended with PURs, and our analysis shows that PURs significantly enhance battery life and latency efficiency, particularly in high-density environments. Compared to the default RAP method, PURs reduce energy consumption by more than 2.5 times and increases battery life by 1.6 times. Additionally, PURs achieve latency reductions of 2.5–3.5 times. The improvements with PURs are most notable for packets up to 125 bytes. Our findings highlight PURs’ potential to enable more efficient and effective CIoT deployments across various scenarios. This study represents a detailed analysis of latency and energy consumption in a simulated environment, advancing the understanding of PURs’ benefits.},
