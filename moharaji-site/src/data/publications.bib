abstract = {The Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) has seen significant growth in recent years. With the deployment of 5G, it has become essential to reduce the power consumption of these devices for long-term sustainability. The upcoming 6G cellular network introduces the concept of zero-energy CIoT devices, which do not require batteries or manual charging. This paper focuses on these devices, providing insight into their feasibility and practical implementation. The paper examines how CIoT devices use simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, beamforming, and backscatter communication techniques. It also analyzes the potential use of energy harvesting and power management in zero-energy CIoT devices. Furthermore, the paper explores how low-power transceivers can lower energy usage while maintaining dependable communication functions.}

ABSTRACT = {Deploying Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) devices in urban and remote areas faces significant energy efficiency challenges. This is especially true for Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) devices, which are expected to function on a single charge for up to 10 years while transmitting small amounts of data daily. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced energy-saving mechanisms in Releases 13 to 16, including Early Data Transmission (EDT) and Preconfigured Uplink Resources (PURs). These mechanisms extend battery life and reduce latency by enabling data transmission without an active Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection or Random Access Procedure (RAP). This paper examines these mechanisms using the LENA-NB simulator in the ns-3 environment, which is a comprehensive framework for studying various aspects of NB-IoT. The LENA-NB has been extended with PURs, and our analysis shows that PURs significantly enhance battery life and latency efficiency, particularly in high-density environments. Compared to the default RAP method, PURs reduce energy consumption by more than 2.5 times and increases battery life by 1.6 times. Additionally, PURs achieve latency reductions of 2.5–3.5 times. The improvements with PURs are most notable for packets up to 125 bytes. Our findings highlight PURs’ potential to enable more efficient and effective CIoT deployments across various scenarios. This study represents a detailed analysis of latency and energy consumption in a simulated environment, advancing the understanding of PURs’ benefits.},

abstract = {The deployment of 5G networks, including 5G Non-Public Networks (5G-NPNs) for private use in several verticals, is rapidly taking place worldwide. However, deploying these networks in under-served areas, where there may be limited Internet access or wired backhauling capabilities, presents challenges. To address these challenges, there is a growing interest in using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, such as SpaceX's Starlink, which can provide high-throughput and low-latency Internet access via dense satellite constellations.In this paper, we present CARL-W, the Wireless module of the Communications Advanced Research Laboratory (CARL) at Karlstad University, which combines a 5G-NPN and a Starlink deployment. CARL-W serves as a platform for empirical analyses on both systems, thus contributing to the study of their possible integration. In particular, we outline the CARL-W experimentation framework and provide access to the CARL-W visualization and data exporting platform. We also open-source a 1-month Starlink dataset, facilitating further analyses of this relatively new technology.},

In this paper, we present the first large-scale measurement study on commercial 5G Non Standalone (NSA) deployments in a European country. We leverage the collected dataset, which covers two Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in Rome, Italy, to first, study network deployment and radio coverage aspects, and second, explore the performance of two use cases related to enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). Results show that 5G NSA can provide higher downlink throughput and slightly lower latency compared to Fourth Generation (4G) systems. However, performance is influenced by several factors, including propagation conditions, system configurations, and handover events, ultimately highlighting the need for further system optimization.},

   abstract = {The successful rollout of fifth-generation (5G) networks requires a full understanding of the behavior of the propagation channel, taking into account the signal formats and the frequencies standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In the past, channel characterization for 5G has been addressed mainly based on the measurements performed on dedicated links in experimental setups. This paper presents a state-of-the-art contribution to the characterization of the outdoor-to-indoor radio channel in the 3.5 GHz band, based on experimental data for commercial, deployed 5G networks, collected during a large scale measurement campaign carried out in the city of Rome, Italy. The analysis presented in this work focuses on downlink, outdoor-to-indoor propagation for two operators adopting two different beamforming strategies, single wide-beam and multiple synchronization signal blocks (SSB) based beamforming; it is indeed the first contribution studying the impact of beamforming strategy in real 5G networks. The time and power-related channel characteristics, i.e., mean excess delay and Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread, path loss, and K-factor are studied for the two operators in multiple measurement locations. The analysis of time and power-related parameters is supported and extended by a correlation analysis between each pair of parameters. The results show that beamforming strategy has a marked impact on propagation. A single wide-beam transmission leads, in fact, to lower RMS delay spread and lower mean excess delay compared to a multiple SSB-based transmission strategy. In addition, the single wide-beam transmission system is characterized by a smaller path loss and a higher K-factor, suggesting that the adoption of a multiple SSB-based transmission strategy may have a negative impact on downlink performance. },

With our analysis, we aim to first, empirically evaluate the current HO strategies followed in 5G NSA, and second, to show the impact of HOs on end-user application performance. Our results show an increased number of intra-RAT HOs, i.e., HOs between cells with the same Radio Access Technology (RAT), in situation where signal quality conditions between multiple candidate cells is on par. In addition, we show that inter-RAT HOs, i.e., HOs between cells with different RATs, can be detrimental to the application performance.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on 5G and Beyond Network Measurements, Modeling, and Use Cases}, pages = {22–27}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {5G NSA, handover analysis, network measurements}, location = {Amsterdam, Netherlands}, series = {5G-MeMU '22} }

This is in part because the design of the network has been optimised to boost throughput, maximising efficiency for bulk applications. However, changes in use have resulted in that an increasing number of applications now depend on timely delivery. One of the targets of the RITE project is to reduce internet transport latency in support of such applications. Initial results from the project on how end nodes can be optimized for more timely error recovery are presented in this poster.},
